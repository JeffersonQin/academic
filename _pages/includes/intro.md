<h2 class="page__title-intro">üëã About Me</h2>

I am Haoyun Qin (Áß¶Êµ©ÂÖÅ). I will be starting as a Research Scientist at [Spellbrush](https://spellbrush.com) in August 2025, working on generative models for the anime domain. 

Prior to that, I received my B.S.E. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/) and worked at [NetDB@UPenn](https://netdb.cis.upenn.edu/).

System-wise, my research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and systems, both **ML Systems** and **ML for Systems**. I also have experience in distributed systems and formal methods.

I do anime / manga / illustration research, both technical and non-technical, in my personal time. You can check out my works on this page, and my reviews on [bangumi](https://bgm.tv/user/gyrojeff). Hope you like them.

<h2 class="page__title-intro">👋 About Me</h2>

Hi! I am Haoyun Qin (秦浩允), a second year undergrad student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://upenn.edu) majoring in Computer Science (expected graduation in 3 years, 2025). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/) and working at [NetDB@UPenn](https://netdb.cis.upenn.edu/). My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and systems, both **ML Systems** and **ML for Systems**. I also have experience in distributed systems, formal methods, and computer vision.
